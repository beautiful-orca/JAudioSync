## JAudioSync  
Project is in **very early developement!** :cowboy_hat_face:  

Play a (m3u8) playlist of music in perfect sync on multiple devices.  
Syncing NTP time over wireless network first and then start pygame.mixer.music playback at exact choosen time (using apscheduler), which then doesn't need network anymore because it depends on system clock. RTC (RealTimeClock) helps keeping correct time.  

**Example music with different license is present at ./Music at the moment**  
- See [./Music/music_license.md](./Music/music_license.md)  

### Use Cases
[Critical Mass Bike Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling))
   - Multiple speakers distributed on Cargo Bikes and trailers
   - Moving with changing conditions which make a network dependant solution hard or costly to implement (Mesh Wifi problems)

    - Announced plans to publish soon

### How to use (dev version)
- `git clone -b dev https://github.com/beautiful-orca/JAudioSync.git`
- `cd JAudioSync`
    - get updates: `git pull origin dev`
- Place mp3 fies in [./Music/](./Music/)  
    - make sure they are mp3 and are properly tagged title, artist and have the property length
- Use VLC (or similar music player) to create a "m3u8" playlist, eg. party.m3u8, in [./Music/](./Music/)  
- Run: `python JAudioSync.py [-h] [-t 18:55:00] [-p 0 | res] [-l | -playlist_name Playlist]`
    - `-t`, optional: Time the playback should be scheduled today in the format hh:mm:ss, default: in 5-20 seconds (at 5,20,35,50)  
    - `-p`, optional: Start track number in playlist, 0 - (number of tracks), or "res" to resume from last played track, default: starting from 0  
    - `-l`, optional flag: Fast-loading last saved playlist (when present), default: reading new playlist from storage
    - `-playlist_name`, optional: Pick custom playlist name in ./Music, default: "Playlist"

### Example
```
python3 JAudioSync.py

### ToDo, Future Ideas, Challenges and Notes
- music playback on Pi 3A+ and Pi 3B+ is in sync when starting with synced time
    - Software clock drifts after a while without network connection
    - audible when both sources are close to each other
    - RTC is nessessary

- Add DS3231 Real Time Clock Module to avoid system clock drift when without network connection to NTP Server
    - [https://www.berrybase.de/ds3231-real-time-clock-modul-fuer-raspberry-pi](https://www.berrybase.de/ds3231-real-time-clock-modul-fuer-raspberry-pi)
- NTP Server on leader
    - chrony
    - sync from pool.ntp.org over mobile phone wifi hotspot with internet
- forcing resync on `timedatectl`:
    - `sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd`

- keep script running without active ssh connection
    - `screen`
        - detatch Ctrl+Shift+A then D
        - reattach `screen -r`
        - "screen works badly with systemd"
    - `nohup python -u your_code.py`
    - start with systemd
        - `systemctl start myPythonScript`
    - `tmux pythonScript.py`
        - `tmux attach`


- Stopping music playback on demand (local possible: CTRL+C, end() on KeyboardInterrupt)
    - `pkill -9 -f JAudioSync.py`
        - does not run end()
- Server and Client model
    - Auto-discovery, based on hostnames (server "leader" scans for hostnames "member(n)")
    - Command control server, "leader" copies comands it gets and distributes them to every member by discovered hostnames
- Common interface: distribute commands to all clients at the same time
   - ssh password auth, common password to add all hostnames found with pattern, eg jasm1, jasm2, jasm(n)
   - key auth from phone (Termux) to leader to control without need for password


- GPS Time Sync (5-10â‚¬ per gps module)
    - [https://www.haraldkreuzer.net/en/news/using-gps-module-set-correct-time-raspberry-pi-3-a-plus-without-network](https://www.haraldkreuzer.net/en/news/using-gps-module-set-correct-time-raspberry-pi-3-a-plus-without-network)

- Maybe rename project
- Move git to privacy friendly hoster?






### Dependencies needed to be installed
I am using Python 3.11.5 in a anaconda venv  
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html)
- [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/)

(Other Linux installs similar, use e.g. balena-etcher to flash and config files on flash memory)  
- Install Pi OS Lite 64bit with Raspberry Pi Imager  
    - 3 B+ as leader and 3 A+ as member in my case
    - Set hostname for "leader" and "member[n]" jasl, jasm1
    - set username and password, jas:secret  
    - Wifi config with internet access or use wired internet for install and update  
    - Set locale  
    - Enable ssh password authentication  
    - `ssh jas@jasl.local`

    - `cd JAudioSync`
    
### Configuration in live system
- Wifi configuration: 
    - use `sudo raspi-config`
    - or `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
- Set Hostname in live system (single word, without domain ".local")
    - use `sudo raspi-config`
